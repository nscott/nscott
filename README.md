## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I make https://dockethealth.com!

Previously I worked at Amazon/AWS.

Cool stuff I did on cool teams:
* Robot Mitigation: Helped drop traffic to global Amazon retail properties by *50%* due to bots and scrapers! We used AI before it was cool.
* AWS Lambda: My dream job! I built a 0-RTT encryption daemon that had extremely tight latency and memory requirements. We deployed it and encrypted ALL network traffic for Lambda *and no one even noticed*! I also rebuilt Lambda's traffic routing to increase availability during deployments.
* AWS EC2: I worked on Time Sync, which was responsible for NTP clocks in all AWS data centers. Notable cool things: going onto the roof of one of the us-east-1 data centers, figuring out how AWS Outposts would synchronize time, deleting tens of thousands of lines of over-engineered code, figuring out leap smearing, and a design for a [daemon](https://github.com/aws/clock-bound) that could tell the clock error bound for consumers!
* Buy With Prime: Did you know logistics are hard? What about disentangling 10+ years of logistics inside of Amazon that were touched by tens of thousands of engineers to show the delivery promise date? That's what I did when I designed the pre-checkout experience for https://buywithprime.amazon.com/

In a more distant past, I spent time at [RJMetrics](https://streamkap.substack.com/p/the-rjmetrics-mafia) and [LeanSentry](https://www.leansentry.com/about).
